# HouseLights's Gallery

This gallery is meant to give an idea of the HouseLights web UI. Note that HouseLights is mainly a service to run a schedule automatically, and thus its UI is minimal.

The HouseLights main web page is used to view and prepare the schedule for the automatic activation of lights:

The top line is a navigation bar that gives access to the HouseLights major pages.

The table lists all the scheduled activations, and allow changes to this schedule.

The control page is used to manually control devices. Note that HouseLights automatically identify all devices using the HousePortal service discovery mechanisms, so there is no need to declare devices in HouseLights.

The event page shows a record of the major changes detected by the HouseLights service. It's main purpose is to help troubleshoot issues with device discovery and control.
